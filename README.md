# /r/place Clone

For April Fools Day (1st April) 2017, Reddit created /r/place, an interactive subreddit in which users can place tiles onto a large canvas to collectively make artwork.

This is my Javascript + PHP clone of Reddit's /r/place. It differs in a couple of ways, i.e. you do not need accounts to add tiles, there is no time limit before you are allowed to place tiles again (on Reddit you have to wait 5 minutes between each tile you place) and the canvas is somewhat smaller.

However, this project would be a good starting point for a place-like project.
